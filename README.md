## Module 3 Challenge
Actually used ChatGPT to help me write code.
I changed original code to add better functionality noted in the JavaScript and Css.
Dennis Itua helped me understand every line of code. He was a tutor I got. He was also very helpful.
I noted in the files the places Dennis helped. 
IN doing the next Challenge I wished I hadn't used ChatGPT.
Dennis let me know that ChatGpt is okay but doesn't always think of every senario.
Overall I learned a lot from this Challenge that helped me with the Challenge for Module 4.
